input_1 = """There was a time when peanut butter was the hero of school lunches. Today, it’s the villain. 

Allergies are serious business. Over 6 million people in the U.S. are allergic to the legume. Even airlines stopped handing out little bags of nuts. But new choices aim to please sandwich lovers and fill candies like “peanut butter” cups without the nuts — or even the chocolate around it. 

Voyage Foods, a startup in West Oakland, has raised more than $40 million on that premise. Its first products, creamy peanut-free spread and decadent hazelnut- and cocoa-free “chocolate” modeled on Nutella, have even made their way onto school cafeteria menus in the Bay Area.

In addition to its peanut-free spread, Voyage joins a clutch of startups that are making chocolate without cacao, including Planet A Foods, California Cultured and WNWN Food Labs. The chocolate business, despite COVID and inflation, was up 9.1% in 2022, for a valuation of $23.9 billion, according to the National Confectioners Association.

Four billion of that dollar figure was pulled in over the seven-week Valentine’s Day season. If Voyage could capture 1% of that amount, they would match its investors’ money. And CEO Adam Maxwell would love to see his chocolate-free ingredient enrobing every heart candy on the shelves of grocery stores.

Maxwell founded Voyage in 2021, but his love affair with food began much earlier. He asked his parents for a KitchenAid stand mixer for his bar mitzvah, and later channeled his interest into a food chemistry degree from McGill University.

In starting Voyage, Maxwell’s idea was this: With our climate changing rapidly, how can we make our favorite products accessible forever? Peanut butter, chocolate and coffee topped his list because of their systemic production issues.

“Either someone’s gonna be paying $50 for a cup of coffee in 20 or 30 years, or they’re gonna be doing things like this,” he said. 

Chocolate is a commodity concealed in complexity. The World Wildlife Fund reports that three-quarters of the world’s cocoa is grown in West Africa, where cultivation of cacao is the leading cause of deforestation, and prices are breaking records due to extreme weather conditions. The industry is propped up on small-scale farmers who aren’t paid a living wage for their work and live in extreme poverty, and it can involve child labor: According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 1.56 million children were involved in cocoa production in Ivory Coast and Ghana, which produce almost 60% of the world’s cacao. 

Cacao beans are harvested from pods, with the beans and pulp inside fermented for flavor. Beans are then dried, roasted, removed from their shells and ground. The last step is tempering, which creates the solid chocolate bar most of us love. 

“I think chocolate is, like from a technical perspective, the most beautiful, amazing food matrix,” Maxwell said. 

To mimic flavors, Maxwell hired food scientist Kelsey Tenney to head research and development at Voyage. Maxwell and Tenney used molecular chemistry to find the notes that were driving the strongest taste in peanut butter and chocolate. The pair was familiar with this kind of detective work from their time working at Endless West, a “molecular spirits” company that makes synthetic whiskey without grain or aging time in barrels. 

You can’t find Voyage’s chocolate in a candy bar yet, but the base is found in the hazelnut-free chocolate spread. Some of its ingredients are roasted like traditional cocoa beans, and others are tailored to match the flavor profile of Voyage’s final target. It also uses compounds made from yeast or fungi to fill in gaps. “It’s difficult to impart a bright citrus or floral note using thermal processes,” Tenney said. “But often these top notes are important to add complexity.”

Voyage’s ingredients are processed in-house on the same equipment used by chocolate makers, plus a few proprietary machines in a 25,000-square-foot facility in West Oakland. It’s also Voyage’s headquarters, with a little bit of everything: tiny mismatched desks, one conference room and a lab filled with scientists using spectrometers, analyzing compounds, mapping out possible source materials, and developing flavors. The majority of the space is set aside for ingredient storage, pallets of product and whirring machines picked up at auction.

Tasting a square of semisweet Voyage chocolate is slightly bizarre. The mouthfeel is excellent, but also with a hint of “hmm, something here is different.” Crunch into it on a chocolate-covered pretzel, however, and you might hardly notice. Ultimately, the startup wants to provide ingredients to other brands as an allergen-free and climate-resilient base for future foods — perhaps coating M&M’s or Snickers bars. To prove Voyage’s merit, Maxwell decided to make branded products first. 

Compared with chocolate, peanut butter might seem simple. You need peanuts, salt and a machine to grind them. But making a delicious spread that evokes peanut butter — the roasted flavor, smooth texture and fatty consistency — with none of the same ingredients was difficult.

Tenney started with sunflower seed butters. But she found most on the market had musty or even rancid flavors. Unlike Voyage’s approach, she said, “These products aim to have general roasty notes, but they’re not mimicking peanut butter by design.” 

Because peanut butter is so wholesome — high in protein and natural fats — Voyage wanted to make its own from similarly uncluttered whole-food ingredients. Both the peanut-free and “hazelnut” spreads use roasted sunflower kernels, grape seeds and a protein blend either from chickpea and rice or sunflower, plus sugar and palm oil.

Voyage has landed in specialty grocers like Nugget Markets, Mollie Stone’s and Rainbow Grocery Cooperative. But Maxwell always had his eye on a bigger fish. “When we started the company, everyone asked, ‘When are you going to be in Whole Foods? ’ And it’s funny because America shops at Walmart.

In an unusual twist, Voyage was written up for its packaging in a trade magazine seen by Walmart’s senior buyer of spreads. One visit later to Walmart headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., and Voyage is now available at 1,250 stores nationally for $4.48 per 16-ounce jar. It’s also at more than 200 Save Mart, Lucky and FoodMaxx stores across the Bay Area.

How close is Voyage to its ambitious climate goals?  A recent analysis performed by an independent third party found Voyage’s chocolate process uses less water and produces 84% less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional chocolate. While this is preliminary data on manufacturing that has yet to reach scale, it’s still promising.

Howard Yana-Shapiro, retired chief agricultural officer for Mars Inc., applauds Voyage’s innovation and considers the peanut-free spread a potential win for candy producers — a market he called “insatiable.” But for chocolate, he isn’t convinced Voyage is solving the right problem. How does this support farmers, develop new cultivars that are higher yield and drought-resistant, or break up a food chain with an inordinate number of layers? 

“I’m enthusiastic for them,” Yana-Shapiro said. “But chocolate is very, very complicated.”

Yet chocolate could be key for the company. While Voyage’s peanut butter substitute is enticing, its bigger flavor draw is the hazelnut-free chocolate spread. The Oakland Unified School District, a nut- and chocolate-free district, tried out the alt-chocolate spread over the summer. After unanimous kid approval, it’s now served at about 70 schools every two weeks on the district’s supper menu, a meal provided to kids attending after-school programs.

Where can one find such a hodgepodge of items, completely free?

Buy Nothing San Francisco.

For the uninitiated, the Facebook group is a marketplace of unwanted items being offered sans charge — the digital version of putting something out on the curb with a “free” sign.

Users post photos and descriptions of what they no longer want and anyone in the group can claim it. Others post items they’re “in search of,” hoping to save themselves an Amazon order by jogging their neighbors’ memories of what’s languishing in their closets or garages. No bartering or trades. No payments. Just pure, unadulterated gifting via social media.

The idea is to avoid waste and unnecessary spending by shuffling items between neighbors. In a Buy Nothing utopia, a neighborhood would share the same set of baby shower decorations over and over; a coffee table would pass through dozens of homes (but never Goodwill) as residents move in and out.

The “Buy Nothing” concept was created in Washington state in 2013 by Liesl Clark and Rebecca Rockefeller, who formalized it as the Buy Nothing Project. They say they originally hoped Buy Nothing groups, which were hosted on Facebook from the beginning, would reduce plastic waste by encouraging reuse.

In the decade since, the concept has exploded and spread. The Buy Nothing directory lists groups in more than 40 countries and hundreds in California. These groups follow a fleshed-out set of guidelines, including the types of gifts permitted (i.e. gifts of self, talent or stuff), practicing patience and limiting networks to hyper-local communities. Thus, there are 18 groups listed in San Francisco alone: one for Bayview / Hunters Point, Central Richmond, Inner Richmond, SoMa, the Castro, and so on. Recently, the Buy Nothing Project founders have tried to shift communities away from Facebook and onto a proprietary app — without much success.

But a quick search on Facebook reveals many more groups, which have split away from the official Buy Nothing Project. Some connect gifters across the city, some are “no rules” communities anyone can join, and some are devoted to specific types of giveaways, like kids’ stuff or Burner paraphernalia. 

The oldest is Buy Nothing San Francisco. Moderators enforce a separate set of guidelines, but the basic ethos is the same: No exchanging money or goods — only free gifts are allowed among the group’s 24,000 members. All exchanges must take place in San Francisco, and posts offering illegal items, drugs and live animals are banned. In addition to a few rules governing good behavior and civility, the guidelines promise that members are free to give however and to whomever they want.

Julia Pfeiffenberger created the group in 2016 and still administers it. The group grew so much during the pandemic that Pfeiffenberger and other moderators decided to stop accepting new members and focus only on maintaining the existing community. 

In addition to an influx of members suddenly stuck at home with their stuff and more time to surf the internet, the pandemic also brought more posts in search of food and other basic necessities. Pfeiffenberger saw members rally to support their struggling neighbors. Today, she still notices people going out of their way to deliver food or help a home-bound neighbor do laundry (members can request services, too).

“The group’s members show the promise of the circular economy,” Pfeiffenberger said, referencing an economic model centered on reusing materials as much as possible. “It’s not perfect; there are still hiccups with pick-up and drop-off coordination. But members value community, ecology and the economy.”

Liz Cahill, a Buy Nothing aficionado, shares Pfeiffenberger’s belief in the power of the concept. She’s been a member of Buy Nothing San Francisco since 2021 and created a separate clothing-focused group, Free Clothing San Francisco, earlier this year. She recently posted in search of a warmer duvet and plans to give away her current bedding once a cozier blanket is secured.

“It can feel demoralizing to see news about climate change and division across the country,” Cahill said, “but when you have spaces online for giving and receiving, you see a different narrative. It’s wonderful to see community building online and people getting their needs met by their neighbors.”

What are those needs? The Chronicle examined a week’s worth of activity to see what people were giving and receiving. We found that Buy Nothing S.F. members made about 70 posts a day, 75% of which gave items away. Many posts offered multiple items, adding up to over 300 cast-offs gifted each day.

Occasionally, the group creates real-life miracles fit for a local news segment: a family down on their luck receiving Christmas toys from more prosperous homes across the city; a dozen accidentally-ordered frozen turkeys passed out by Thanksgiving; a desperate search for a concert ticket, unexpectedly fulfilled. 

But mostly, the group is a steady stream of mundane munificence."""

input_3 = """Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr was honored Tuesday with the Rudy Tomjanovich Award, given annually by the Pro Basketball Writers Association to the NBA coach who best exemplifies combined cooperation with the media and fans with excellence on the court.

The award is named after Tomjanovich, a former NBA forward and head coach best known for guiding the Houston Rockets to consecutive championships in 1994 and 1995 — but also known for his professionalism during interactions with reporters. 

Kerr, 58, previously won the award in 2015 and 2018. This season, he beat finalists Chris Finch (Minnesota Timberwolves), Darvin Ham (Los Angeles Lakers), Michael Malone (Denver Nuggets) and Jamahl Mosley (Orlando Magic) for his third honor.

Formerly an NBA broadcaster for TNT, Kerr has long mused thoughtfully with the media — offering insights regularly about the Warriors, the league at large and topics beyond basketball. He routinely granted one-on-one interviews with local and national reporters alike.

At his annual end-of-the-season news conference last month at Chase Center, he opened by thanking reporters for their coverage.

“Not every coach actually enjoys these (news conferences). I enjoy these. I enjoy seeing you guys,” he said. “I never forget what our business is about, which is connecting our team to our fans. Telling our players’ stories. … So, I just want to tell you, I appreciate the difficulty of your job and you guys do a really good job of covering our team and telling our stories and connecting our fans and all of that is really important.”"""
